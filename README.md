# 
This is where I do computations with integers for fun!<br>

## Prime sieve
This isn't really using sieve methods just yet.<br>
Simple enough to hunt for primes while the prime numbers are under 2^64 (I'll probably never surpass that ':..(')<br>

## Factorizer
(doesn't exist just yet...)
I also want to store factorizations of numbers (or at least compute them) up to 2^32.<br>
There's a sequence I want to calculate the 2^32 term of, and I need all those factors.<br>
